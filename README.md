# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. I have taken the dataset of the previous breast cancer patients and train the model to predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant. These predictions will help doctors to do surgeries only when the cancer is malignant, thus reducing the unnecessary surgeries for women.
